# OSM Tree Warden

A web application for managing and visualizing trees in OpenStreetMap data.

## Features

### Tree Management
- **View Trees**: Display trees from OpenStreetMap data on an interactive map
- **Tree Details**: View detailed information about individual trees including species, genus, and metadata
- **Tree Validation**: Automatic validation of tree data with warnings and suggestions
- **Tree Addition**: Add new trees to the map with species selection

### Map Features
- **Interactive Map**: Built with React Leaflet for smooth navigation
- **Background Layers**: Switch between OpenStreetMap and NRW Orthophoto layers
- **Real-time Loading**: Trees are loaded automatically as you navigate the map
- **Tree Markers**: Visual markers for trees with different states (selected, has errors, etc.)

### Data Management
- **Patch System**: Make local changes to tree data before uploading to OSM
- **Validation**: Real-time validation of tree properties
- **Export**: Generate OSM-compatible XML for uploading changes

## Tree Addition Feature

### How to Add Trees

1. **Click the Plus Button**: Look for the green ‚ûï button in the top-right corner of the map
2. **Select Tree Type**: Choose between:
   - üçé **Apple** (Malus domestica)
   - üçê **Pear** (Pyrus communis)
3. **Place the Tree**: Click anywhere on the map to place your selected tree
4. **Tree Added**: The new tree will appear on the map with the appropriate species information

### Tree Types Available

- **Apple Tree** (`Malus domestica`): Common apple tree species
- **Pear Tree** (`Pyrus communis`): Common pear tree species

More tree types can be easily added by extending the tree addition functionality.

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Nanostores for reactive state
- **Maps**: React Leaflet with OpenStreetMap tiles
- **Styling**: CSS Modules for component-scoped styles
- **Testing**: Vitest with React Testing Library

### Key Components
- `Map`: Main map component with tree layer and controls
- `TreeLayer`: Renders tree markers on the map
- `TreeList`: Displays list of trees with details
- `Settings`: Application settings and store management
- `MapControls`: Map control buttons including tree addition
- `TreeTypeSelector`: Modal for selecting tree types

### Data Flow
1. Map bounds change ‚Üí Load trees from Overpass API
2. Trees loaded ‚Üí Display on map and in tree list
3. User interactions ‚Üí Update local state
4. Changes made ‚Üí Store in patch system
5. Export ‚Üí Generate OSM-compatible XML
